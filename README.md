# FYP-KeyLogger-

This is a login platform that uses Keystroke and Mouse dynamics to verify a user login attempt through Naive Bayes and Fuzzy Logic algorithms respectively.
The goal was that even with the right login credentials, the platform will still deny entry if the result value during login is different from the result value during registration.

ALL THE FUNCTIONS AND THE MAIN PROGRAM WILL BE STORED 
IN A FILE CALLED module1.py
